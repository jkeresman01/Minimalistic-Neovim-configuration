## Package manager ##
Although unmaintained from August, 2023, I'am still using Packer as my package manager.

If you wan't to install packer you can do it with:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```
You can find more information about packer here:
